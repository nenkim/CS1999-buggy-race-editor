    I forked the repo on GitHub and then used <code>git clone</code> to make
    a local copy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to
    version control as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo
    at the end of each day. I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a
    SSH key so I didn't need to enter username and password every time I
    pushed.
